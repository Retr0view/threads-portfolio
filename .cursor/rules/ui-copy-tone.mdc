### UI copy tone (Family-inspired)

Ground rules for microcopy, labels, empty states, errors, and confirmations. This complements `rules/writing.mdc` and the principles in `rules/family-values.mdc`.

## Tone

- **Human and direct**: Say the thing plainly. Use everyday words.
- **Warm confidence**: Sound sure, not hyped. Avoid fluff.
- **Action-first**: Lead with verbs and outcomes.
- **Contextual**: Speak to what the person is doing right now.
- **Light touch of delight**: A small wink in rare moments; stay invisible in frequent flows.

## Style

- **Use active voice**: "Save backup" not "Backup will be saved."
- **Prefer short sentences**: One idea per line in UI surfaces.
- **Use contractions**: "You're set." "You can change this later."
- **Avoid jargon**: Prefer concrete nouns and verbs.
- **Numbers > adjectives**: Be specific when space allows.

## Labels and buttons

- Use verbs that describe the next step: "Approve swap," "Show recovery phrase," "Try again."
- Avoid vague labels: not "Continue," unless the destination is obvious.
- Keep button text 1–3 words; clarify with a subtitle or helper text if needed.

## Titles and helper text

- Titles name the task in plain words: "Confirm approval," "Back up your wallet."
- Helper text tells them what happens next or why it matters; keep it under 1–2 short lines.
- Match the surface: if it's a tray, the copy focuses on a single decision.

## Errors

- Be specific and solvable: say what went wrong and what to do.
- Use a calm tone: "Can't connect right now. Check your network and try again."
- If you need the person to wait, set expectations: "This can take up to 30 seconds."

## Success and confirmations

- Confirm with a verb + outcome: "Backup saved."
- Add brief delight for rare, important wins (e.g., backup complete). Keep common successes minimal.

## Empty states

- Teach with a nudge: one-line guidance + a clear action.
- Avoid apologizing or filler. Offer a path.

## Frequency vs. delight (copy application)

- Frequent flows: keep copy minimal and neutral; skip jokes.
- Infrequent or celebratory flows: allow a small flourish (one word or a short phrase) without adding steps.

## Do / Don't

- Do: "Approve swap to continue."
- Don't: "Please proceed with the approval process to seamlessly continue."

- Do: "Backup saved."
- Don't: "Your backup has been successfully completed!"

- Do: "Can't connect. Check your network and try again."
- Don't: "A network connectivity issue has occurred. Please troubleshoot."

## Voice checks (quick pass)

- Is it the fewest words that still clarifies the action?
- Would a person say this out loud?
- Does it match the surface's single purpose?
- Is there unnecessary ceremony in a frequent flow?
- For rare moments, is there one small delightful touch that doesn't slow the task?
