### Family values: simplicity, fluidity, delight

Use these rules to translate Family's product philosophy into concrete design and interaction decisions.

## Core principles

- **Simplicity**: Show only what matters now; reveal depth gradually.
- **Fluidity**: Maintain spatial and narrative continuity across every transition.
- **Delight**: Add small, intentional moments that reward attention without adding friction.

## Simplicity: gradual revelation

- **Progressive disclosure**: Default to minimal UI; reveal options when context makes them relevant.
- **One thing per surface**: Each step/surface focuses on a single task or message.
- **Context preservation**: Prefer overlays that maintain sight of origin rather than hard page changes.
- **Clear labeling**: Every surface has a concise title that sets expectation and anchors the task.
- **Back/dismiss affordance**: Always provide a clear path to undo, go back, or close.
- **Height differentiation**: For sequential overlays, vary heights to signal forward progress.
- **Theming by context**: Match surface theme (light/dark, tone) to its parent context.
- **Transient vs. persistent**: Use overlays for ephemeral, contextual actions; use full screens for durable destinations.

## Tray system rules (for overlay-style flows)

- **Initiation**: Trays are invoked by explicit user actions (tap, notification, icon) and should originate from their trigger.
- **Singular purpose**: Each tray handles a single action or piece of content; avoid mixed intents.
- **Stacking**: Sequence trays one-by-one; ensure each successive tray has a distinct height to clarify state changes.
- **Navigation**: The leading control dismisses the first tray; subsequent trays use it to navigate backwards.
- **Continuity**: Animate from the trigger and keep background content visible to preserve orientation.

## Fluidity: seamless transitions

- **Every motion explains a change**: Motions must clarify what changed and where it went; never decorate.
- **Spatial links**: Transform elements between states rather than swapping abruptly; prefer shared element transitions.
- **Dimensionality**: Use depth (scale, blur, parallax) sparingly to convey layering without distraction.
- **Consistent cadence**: Keep timing and easing consistent across similar interactions.
- **Onboarding sets the tone**: Early flows should demonstrate fluidity clearly; avoid jarring cuts.
- **Trust-through-smoothness**: Avoid glitchy or inconsistent transitions that erode confidence.

### Motion specifics

- Defer easing, duration, properties, accessibility, and performance details to Animation Feeling Rules.

## Delight: selective emphasis

- **Place delight where novelty is highest**: Rarer actions can carry more flourish; common ones stay subtle.
- **Surprise, not distraction**: Easter eggs should be opt-in or discoverable without blocking tasks.
- **Micro-feedback**: Use tactile details (tiny number formatting shifts, gentle ripples) to reward input.
- **Finish strong**: Celebrate meaningful completions (e.g., backup success) with brief, tasteful effects.
- **Consistency first**: Keep quality consistent everywhere so delight never highlights uneven spots.

### Delight impact guidelines

- **Frequency vs. intensity**: The less frequent the feature, the more delight it can accommodate.
- **Never slow the core path**: Delight must never add steps or delay completion.
- **Recoverability**: Delightful interactions must be reversible or ignorable.

## Decision checklist

- **Simplicity**: Is the surface focused on one thing? Are we revealing only what's relevant now?
- **Continuity**: Does the transition preserve spatial context and explain where things went?
- **Clarity**: Is the title, action, and back/dismiss affordance obvious?
- **Delight**: Is any flourish appropriately scaled to frequency and importance?
- **Motion specifics**: For easing, timing, properties, accessibility, and performance, follow Animation Feeling Rules.

## When to use trays vs full screens

- **Use trays** when the action is contextual, transient, and benefits from preserving background context (confirmation, warnings, quick setup steps).
- **Use full screens** when the new place is durable, information-dense, or becomes a working space.

## Examples to emulate

- Contextual approvals that originate from the initiating surface and resolve without losing place.
- First-use education blended into the surface instead of separate tutorial screens.
- Gentle celebratory effects after important but infrequent tasks (e.g., confetti on backup complete).

## Anti-patterns

- Dumping all features up-front without context.
- Identical overlay heights in a sequence, causing ambiguous state progression.
- Glitchy or abrupt transitions that break orientation.
- Over-delighting common flows (send, type, navigate) with heavy animations.
- Delight that blocks, distracts, or cannot be skipped.
