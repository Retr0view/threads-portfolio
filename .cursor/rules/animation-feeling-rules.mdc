### Animation Feeling Rules

Use these rules to make motion feel natural, purposeful, and tasteful. They distill the ideas from the "What makes an animation feel right?" lesson into actionable guidance.

## Principles

- **Natural**: Motion should mirror everyday physics. Avoid surprises in velocity and direction. Linear motion feels robotic; most real movement accelerates and decelerates.
- **Purposeful**: Animate to support the user's goal, not to decorate. The more often an interaction occurs, the lighter or shorter the animation should be.
- **Tasteful**: Apply rules with judgment. Build references, compare options, and choose what looks and feels best for the context.

## Easing

- **Avoid linear** for organic UI motion; it feels lifeless.
- **Use ease-out** for exits/settling transitions; fast start, gentle stop.
- **Use ease-in-out** for entrances or state changes where both start and end should feel soft.
- **Consider spring/overshoot** for playful micro-interactions; keep amplitudes and bounciness subtle.

### Easing rules

- Don't use built-in CSS easings unless it's `ease` or `linear`.
- Use the following easings for their described use case:

  - **`ease-in`** (starts slow, speeds up) — generally avoid; makes UI feel slow.
    - `ease-in-quad`: `cubic-bezier(.55, .085, .68, .53)`
    - `ease-in-cubic`: `cubic-bezier(.550, .055, .675, .19)`
    - `ease-in-quart`: `cubic-bezier(.895, .03, .685, .22)`
    - `ease-in-quint`: `cubic-bezier(.755, .05, .855, .06)`
    - `ease-in-expo`: `cubic-bezier(.95, .05, .795, .035)`
    - `ease-in-circ`: `cubic-bezier(.6, .04, .98, .335)`

  - **`ease-out`** (starts fast, slows down) — best for elements entering or user-initiated interactions.
    - `ease-out-quad`: `cubic-bezier(.25, .46, .45, .94)`
    - `ease-out-cubic`: `cubic-bezier(.215, .61, .355, 1)`
    - `ease-out-quart`: `cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1)`
    - `ease-out-quint`: `cubic-bezier(.23, 1, .32, 1)`
    - `ease-out-expo`: `cubic-bezier(.19, 1, .22, 1)`
    - `ease-out-circ`: `cubic-bezier(.075, .82, .165, 1)`

  - **`ease-in-out`** (smooth acceleration and deceleration) — ideal for elements moving within the screen.
    - `ease-in-out-quad`: `cubic-bezier(.455, .03, .515, .955)`
    - `ease-in-out-cubic`: `cubic-bezier(.645, .045, .355, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-quart`: `cubic-bezier(.77, 0, .175, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-quint`: `cubic-bezier(.86, 0, .07, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-expo`: `cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-circ`: `cubic-bezier(.785, .135, .15, .86)`

## Duration

- **Frequent interactions** (hovers, buttons, small toggles): ~120–180 ms.
- **Component/state changes** (cards, modals, drawers): ~180–240 ms.
- **Large layout changes** (page transitions): ~220–320 ms.
- Favor the shortest duration that still reads clearly.

### Keep your animations fast

- Default to `ease-out` for most animations.
- Avoid durations longer than 1s (unless illustrative). Most should be ~0.2–0.3s.

## What to Animate

- **Prefer** `transform` and `opacity` for smooth, GPU-friendly motion.
- **Defer** layout-changing properties (e.g., width/height, left/top) unless necessary.
- **Use subtle blur** to bridge distinct visual states when swapping content; it blends states and reduces perceived jumps.

## Continuity and Clarity

- **Maintain spatial continuity**: Move elements along plausible paths and keep origins consistent.
- **Blend states**: When content changes, soften the swap with opacity, blur, or crossfade—avoid the "two objects" look.
- **Avoid surprise**: Don't animate properties that users don't expect to move (e.g., random rotations on a list item).

## Frequency and Friction

- The more often something happens, the less motion it should use.
- High-frequency interactions should be instant or nearly so; remove staggers from menus or dropdowns that users open repeatedly.

## Accessibility

- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`**: Reduce duration, distance, and vigor of motion; prefer fades/crossfades.
- Ensure motion never blocks task completion; provide immediate alternatives if needed.
- If `transform` is used, disable or significantly reduce it under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Performance

- Aim for **60 fps**; keep animations simple and parallelizable.
- Batch style reads/writes; avoid forced synchronous layouts.
- Test on low-end devices and under load.
- Stick to opacity and transforms when possible; avoid animating layout (`top`, `left`, width/height) for movement.
- Do not animate drag gestures using CSS variables.
- Do not animate blur values higher than 20px.
- Use `will-change` sparingly and only for: `transform`, `opacity`, `clip-path`, `filter`.
- With Motion/Framer Motion, prefer `transform` rather than `x`/`y` when you need hardware acceleration.

## Hover transitions

- Use built-in CSS `ease` with a duration of `200ms` for simple hovers (`color`, `background-color`, `opacity`).
- Fall back to the easing rules above for more complex hover transitions.
- Disable hover transitions on touch devices with `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`.

## Origin-aware animations

- Elements should animate from the trigger. For dropdowns/popovers, animate from the button and set `transform-origin` according to trigger position.

## Spring animations

- Default to spring animations when using Framer Motion.
- Avoid bouncy springs unless working with drag gestures; keep damping high enough to settle quickly.

## Anti-patterns

- Linear easing for organic movement.
- Over-animating common interactions (hover/menus) and adding unnecessary staggers.
- Animations that obscure intent or slow users down.
- Busy motion without a clear cause or destination.

## Practical defaults (drop-in)

- **Easing**: ease-out for transitions; ease-in-out for entrances; gentle spring for micro-interactions.
- **Duration**: 150 ms small; 200 ms medium; 250–300 ms large.
- **Properties**: transform + opacity first; avoid layout-affecting properties.
- **A11y**: implement a `prefers-reduced-motion` path.

## Checklist before shipping

- Does it feel familiar and unsurprising? (Natural)
- Does it help the user achieve a goal faster or clearer? (Purpose)
- Is easing appropriate for the motion type? (Easing)
- Is the duration the shortest that still reads? (Timing)
- Are we animating transform/opacity when possible? (Performance)
- Is frequent interaction friction minimized? (Frequency)
- Does it respect `prefers-reduced-motion`? (Accessibility)
