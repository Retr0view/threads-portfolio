# Rules overview

Use this map to quickly find the right guidance. Files marked "always apply" are default rules; others are situational.

## Where to find what

- UI copy tone — always apply
  - File: `rules/ui-copy-tone.mdc`
  - What: Microcopy for UI surfaces (labels, buttons, titles, helper text, errors, empty states, confirmations).
  - When: Writing text that appears in product UI.

- Writing — always apply
  - File: `rules/writing.mdc`
  - What: Company-wide writing rules (voice/tone, specificity, banned words/phrases, formatting, avoiding LLM-y patterns).
  - When: Any written communication (docs, product copy, posts, reviews).

- Family values (design philosophy)
  - File: `rules/family-values.mdc`
  - What: Product principles: simplicity, fluidity, delight; tray system; when to use trays vs full screens; decision checklist.
  - When: Structuring flows, choosing surfaces, evaluating design decisions.

- Animation feeling rules
  - File: `rules/animation-feeling-rules.mdc`
  - What: Motion principles, easing choices (with bezier references), durations, properties to animate, accessibility, performance, checklists.
  - When: Designing/implementing motion and transitions.

- Mentor
  - File: `rules/mentor.mdc`
  - What: How the assistant teaches a senior designer learning development (explanations after edits, mini-lessons, next steps).
  - When: Interacting in Cursor; guiding workflow and teaching style.
